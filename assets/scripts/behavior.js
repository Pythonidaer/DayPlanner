/*
What I want to do is watch the .gif
I want to watch the .gif to see how one block is made.
I want to build one of the blocks with HTML/CSS.
Once I build the block I want to create an array of 9-5 hours.
Once I build the array, I want to loop over a function.
I want this function to create a block for each (similar to CodingQuiz code).
Once the form is there, local storage and editable input should be the challenge.

// display timeblocks for standard business hours (9am 5pm)

// each time block contains an input field & a save button

// time block save button saves the input text to localStorage, allowing the text to persist when the app is refreshed.

// current day displayed at the top of the calendar (Moment.js / Day.js etc)

// each time block color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future (hour) -- looks like this will compare 9am to the actual time

// Uses moment.js to work with data & time or Luxox, Day.js, date-fns or js-Joda

// AS AN employee who's busy, I WANT to add events to a planner SO THAT I can manage time effectively

// GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
// WHEN I open the planner
// THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
// WHEN I scroll down
// THEN I'm presented with time blocks for standard business hours
// WHEN I view the blocks for that day
// THEN each time block color-coded: past, present or future
// WHEN I click into a time block
// THEN I can enter an event
// WHEN I click the save button for that time block
// THEN the text for that event is saved in localStorage
// WHEN I refreshed the page
// THEN the saved events persist
